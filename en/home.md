# Mastodon Guide

Hello, and welcome to the Mastodon Guide (or `MastoGuide` or `MG` for short).

This guide started as a documentation effort for [my danish Mastodon server `expressional.social`](https://expressional.social/){target=_blank}, but quickly grew into covering a lot more broad topics than anticipated, well beyond topics specific to my server.

I'm a [huge fan of Open Source](https://github.com/jippi){target=_blank}, so I decided to extract all the generic content, guides, and tips and tricks into this stand-alone project you're looking at now. You can [find the source code on GitHub](https://github.com/jippi/masto-guide){target=_blank} if you are curious or would like to contribute.

My goal is to provide a high-quality resource for everything Mastodon and transition the project from a solo project to a community-maintained resource in multiple languages and with broader width and depth of content than it currently has today.

If you want to help, found a typo or something else entirely, feel free to [check out the source code on GitHub](https://github.com/jippi/masto-guide){target=_blank} or  [send me an message on Mastodon (`@jippi@expressional.social`)](https://expressional.social/@jippi){target=_blank}

## Where to go from here?

Feel free to explore the different options in the menu to the left - there is a lot of great articles in there.

For example, we've written a bit about [things to consider when choosing a Mastodon server](/en/learn/choosing-a-Mastodon-server), [how to change Mastodon server](/en/guide/move-to-another-mastodon-server), a [Twitter to Mastodon guide](guide/twitter-and-mastodon.md) and a great [guide on getting started on Mastodon](guide/getting-started-on-mastodon.md)

If you have ideas for guides, questions needing answering or anything else, [please let us know on GitHub](https://github.com/jippi/masto-guide){target=_blank}
