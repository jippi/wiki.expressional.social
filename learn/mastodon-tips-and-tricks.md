# Tips & tricks

## Don't delete your Twitter account!

If you deactivate/delete your Twitter account, your `@handle` will be publicly available in 30 days. The chances that you will be impersonated with no recourse is very high! Donâ€™t do it - especially if you had a fairly popular account.

To safely clean/wipe your account do this instead:

1. [Deactivate your Twitter account](https://twitter.com/settings/deactivate){target="_blank"}
2. Go to [twitter.com/login](https://twitter.com/login){target="_blank"} and reactivate it. All of your followers will be gone.
3. Now lock the account and let it rot.

You can use a tool like [semiphemeral.com](https://semiphemeral.com/){target="_blank"} for wiping data, including DMs.

## Hashtags are king and queen

With no AI or algorithm to push "relevant" content, a huge part of the discovery and exploration of Mastodon is based on hashtags. Use them liberally.

You can also subscribe to hashtags like you would a user:

- Search for the hashtag
- Click on the hashtag in the search result
- In the upper right corner of the list of posts (tweets) there is a small icon looking like a person with a `+` sign on the right-hand side. It's confusingly identical to the "follow user" icon. Click that, and you should get all posts with that hashtag in your regular timeline.

## Featured Hashtags

Did you see a person's profile has some special tags with numbers? Those are "Featured Hashtags." They are useful to present yourself more; for example, I often post about software, so I have `#Software` as a featured hashtag, so everyone can click it and find all **my** posts about software.

To create them:

- Go to `Preferences > Profile > Featured Hashtags`
- You will be offered hashtags you often use
- Type one hashtag, like `#sport`, and `Add`
- Repeat the steps above to add more hashtags

## Advanced UI mode

If you are familiar with Tweetdeck or other 3rd-party Twitter apps, they often support multiple timelines/lane side by side rather than a single list of tweets like Twitter.

This is natively available on the Mastodon web app, and you can change it this way:

- Go to `Preferences`
- Check `Enable advanced web interface`
- Click `Save Changes`
- Go back to your timeline.
- Search a tag you love, for example, `#Food`, `#Sport`, or `#Nature`
- Click a tag found, then a column of that tag appears
- Click the "triple lines" button to the top-right, click `PIN`
- Click `UNPIN` if you want to remove a column

## Lists

Lists help you watch over certain people separately.

For example, you may create three lists of `My Family`, `Colleagues`, `Bots`, which contain your family, and your colleagues, and the bots you follow.

You can create and maintain your lists here in the menu under `Lists`

## Paste an URL/link in the Search Box

The search box supports searching for URLs/links to profiles and posts from other servers. This allows you to open a post or profile from a different server to follow, like, comment, and share the post or profile without opening a new window. This is a nice shortcut.

Example links you can search for:

- [https://expressional.social/@jippi](https://expressional.social/@jippi) - my profile - you can search this link on any server, and my profile will show up
- [https://expressional.social/@jippi/109371126097435854](https://expressional.social/@jippi/109371126097435854) - you can search this link on any server, and my post should show up

## Using your own domaain as alias

Mastodon makes it ~fairly easy for you to add `aliases` to your account so you can be found under names (e.g., your private domain like `jippi.dev`).

For example, my personal domain is `jippi.dev`, and I've set up so `@jippi@jippi.dev` and `@me@jippi.dev` will find my account `@jippi@expressional.social` across all servers. You can think of it as an e-mail redirect/forward.

It can be incredibly useful since it will allow people to find you via your regular e-mail. Since it's a redirect/forward, if you move to another server in the future, your alias can be updated to point to the new server transparently without updating many links across the web.
